# Hello there
This is a repository of flavonoids as anti-diabetic project. The aim of the study is to evaluate the inhibitory activity of both natural and synthetic flavonoids against two anti-diabetic target namely alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase which have crucial role in the metabolism of carbohydrate, thereby being appealing targets for the treatment of diabetes.

## Aims
The project consists of two aims:
1. To evaluate the inhibitory activity of in-house synthesized flavonoid compounds against the two enzymatic targets (writing manuscript)
2. To systematically review the current evidence of flavonoids againts the two enzymes of interests (the protocol of the systematic review was published on: 10.13140/RG.2.2.17980.31368/2)
