# Cheminformatics
This is a repository of Phong to achieve his codes and useful files used in his thesis and his recent projects in the field of cheminformatics and health informatics. 
In this repository, you may find some useful codes used in his projects:
1. GROMACS mdp files used in molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) used in his two publications
2. Python notebooks used to visuallise the data in his publications
3. Python notebooks used to train machine learning models in predicting susceptibility of microbials derived from impatients in a hospital in HoChiMinh City against different types of antimicrobials (In process, writing)
