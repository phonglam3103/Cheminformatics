# Hello there!
This is a repository of Phong to achieve his codes and useful files used in his thesis and his recent projects in the field of cheminformatics and health informatics. 
In this repository, you may find some useful codes used in his projects:
1. GROMACS mdp files used in molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) used in his two publications
2. Python notebooks used to visuallise the data in his publications
3. Python notebooks used to mine the data and group the same flavonoid structures used in a systematic review (In process, writing)
4. Python notebooks used to train machine learning models in predicting susceptibility of microbials derived from impatients in a hospital in HoChiMinh City against different types of antimicrobials (In process, writing)

## About me
I am a pharmacist interested in computer-aided drug design using both in-silico approaches and in-vitro approaches to evaluate the computer-based predictions. My research interests include, but are not limited to metabolism-related syndromes, cardiovascular diseases and auto-inflammatory diseases. My graduation thesis is about finding small molecules that can inhibit the interleukin-33/ST2 axis, which is involved in pathology of inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, using different in-silico methods such as homology modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, I am also involved in synthesizing and purifying the IL-33 protein and using fluorescent spectroscopy to evaluate the binding affinity of screened compounds.
