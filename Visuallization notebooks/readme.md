# Welcome to Phong's place for visuallisation
I have always been intriguing by the beauty of visuallisation on the top-tier journals. Since the first time I acknowledged these figures were created by Python and R, I have always tried my best to reproduce these figures and built my own styles.
In this folder, you may find some:
1. Pymol scripts to customize the bond, the atom label and the representation of either the protein or the ligands.
2. Python notebooks to draw histograms of the distribution of the docking score using seaborns and matplotly
3. Python notebooks to draw ROC curve to evaluate the molecular docking models (Beside RMSD of the cocrystallized ligands)
4. Writing soon...

## How to use?
1. RMSD files: In order to use the RMSD plots, you should have a look at the template csv file (with the data retrieved from the MDs) name *RMSD_p.csv* to know how to use it.
2. Histogram: this notebook was written to plot the distribution of the docking score of the screened compounds from molecular docking process. You can have a look at Vina_sort.csv file to know the format of the input.
