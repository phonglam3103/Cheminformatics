# Welcome to Phong's place for visuallisation
I have always been intriguing by the beauty of visuallisation on the top-tier journals. Since the first time I acknowledged these figures were created by Python and R, I have always tried my best to reproduce these figures and built my own styles.
In this folder, you may find some:
1. Pymol scripts to customize the bond, the atom label and the representation of either the protein or the ligands.
2. Python notebooks to draw histograms of the distribution of the docking score using seaborns and matplotly
3. Python notebooks to draw ROC curve to evaluate the molecular docking models (Beside RMSD of the cocrystallized ligands)
4. Writing soon...
